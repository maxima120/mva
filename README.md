Move All - simmple Linux command line tool to move all files from one directory to another WIHTOUT sub-directories.

I made it because I find it funny that Linux needs an effort to move all files from directory to directory without moving sub-directories. I need this in multiple places so I think its easier to make it once and forget.

USAGE: mva /path/to/source/directory /path/to/target/directory
